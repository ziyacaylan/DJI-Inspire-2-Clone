# DJI-Inspire-2-Clone
Dji inspire 2 clone with 3D printing
I would recommend it to anyone who is into hobbyists. 
I printed the parts on the 3d printer that started 4 years ago. 
I did not complete the project due to the structure of the electronic parts of the drone and the difficulty of transporting it. 
I worked on a different model.
